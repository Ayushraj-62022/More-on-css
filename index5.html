    <p>“Display font” is an informal concept that refers to fonts regarded as suitable (or even designed) for use in “display texts” as opposite to
        normal copy text that typically appears in paragraphs. Headings, headlines, logos, short slogans or quotes rendered as separate blocks, and texts in signs and plates can be regardes as “display texts”.
        If you check the list of fonts you get by selecting “Display” only in the filter, you will see a variety of fonts, often with strong features,
         perhaps artistic and expressionistic, often with special 
        letter forms – things you might use in a heading, but (hopefully) not in the bulk of copy text.
